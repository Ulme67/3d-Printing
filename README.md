Everything about 3d printing

In this branch is made for bedlevelling.
There are G-Codes for different printer sizes and in different languages (only the comments of course)
choos the G-Code that fits for the size of your printbed.

If you own a Artillery Sidewinder X1 -> This code will only work if you send it via Octoprint. I tried it with a SD card and it didn't work. This is a known issue with the Firmware/Display combination. If you send it via Octoprint, you will receive some errors regarding the M0 command. you can ignore them.
